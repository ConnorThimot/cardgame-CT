# Card Games Project

## Project Purpose
This project is a Java-based console card game application developed as part of the INFT4000 course. The initial implementation is a Blackjack (21) game based on Kevin’s Guides, and the project is designed to be extended with additional card games over time.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to provide a modular and extensible card game framework that demonstrates object-oriented programming, version control best practices, and collaborative software development.

## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17 or later)
- Git & GitHub
- IntelliJ

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ
3. Ensure Java is installed and configured
4. Run the main class from the `src` directory

## Extending the Project
Developers can add new card games by creating new game classes that follow the existing structure. Shared components such as decks, cards, and players should be reused where possible.
